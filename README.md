# Healthcare-Data-Analysis-Patient-Demographics-and-Vital-Signs


## Business Problem
The healthcare industry relies heavily on patient data to make informed decisions about treatments, hospital management, and operational improvements. However, managing and extracting actionable insights from this large volume of healthcare data can be complex and time-consuming. This project focuses on analyzing patient data to uncover trends and correlations that could help hospitals, insurance providers, and healthcare professionals in decision-making processes. By understanding patient demographics, medical conditions, treatment types, and financial data, we aim to help improve healthcare service delivery and operational efficiency.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains various patient-related attributes, including demographics, medical conditions, and treatment details, across multiple hospitals. Key columns in the dataset include:

- **Name**: Patient's name 
- **Age**: Patient's age
- **Gender**: Patient's gender
- **Blood Type**: Patient's blood type
- **Medical Condition**: Diagnosed medical condition
- **Date of Admission**: Date the patient was admitted to the hospital
- **Doctor**: Name of the doctor treating the patient
- **Hospital**: Name of the hospital where treatment is provided
- **Insurance Provider**: Name of the insurance provider
- **Billing Amount**: Total cost of treatment
- **Room Number**: Room assigned to the patient
- **Admission Type**: Type of admission (e.g., emergency, elective)
- **Discharge Date**: Date the patient was discharged
- **Medication**: Medication prescribed during treatment
- **Test Results**: Results from various medical tests conducted during the hospital stay

## Key Questions Explored:
1. What are the most common medical conditions among different age groups?
2. How does the treatment cost vary across different hospitals and insurance providers?
3. What are the patterns in admission types (emergency vs elective) based on medical conditions and demographics?
4. Can we identify correlations between medications prescribed and test results for specific conditions?
5. How do hospital room types or doctor specializations affect patient discharge time or recovery?

## Tools & Techniques Used:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Insights Generation**: Statistical analysis and visual representation of healthcare trends

## Goal of the Project
The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from the patient dataset that can be leveraged to make data-driven decisions for improving hospital operations, patient care, and billing processes. The findings will be visualized in an accessible manner to support healthcare administrators and professionals in their decision-making.
